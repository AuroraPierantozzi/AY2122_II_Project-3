## PCB DESIGN with EAGLE 


To develop the PCB with EAGLE, instead of using the symbols and footprints of the various components, we used the Connectors from the Sparkfun library.
In this way we used all the available space and we developed a more compact PCB.

We used:
- For the PSOC -> 22 connectors, carefully spaced in order to follow the component dimensions.
- For the IMU -> 6 connectors, carefully spaced in order to follow the component dimensions.
- For the HC-06 Bluetooth module -> 4 connectors in order to follow the component dimensions.
- For the voltage regulator -> 3 connectors.
- For the battery -> 2 connectors.
- For the LED and for the button (which was not used later) -> 2 connectors. 
- For the 330 Ohm resistance -> component symbol and footprint.  

After developing the PCB with the standard procedure we soldered the female headers on it and we added the components.
